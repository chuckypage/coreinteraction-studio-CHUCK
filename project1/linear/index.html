		NASA PLANS SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE
	</div>

	<div class="second">
		One year from now, on Oct. 12, 1992, 500 years after 
Columbus' discovery of America, NASA will begin the most 
comprehensive search ever conducted for evidence of intelligent 
life elsewhere in the universe.

The NASA Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) 
microwave observing project is a ground-based decade-long effort 
to detect microwave radio transmissions that may have been 
deliberately or inadvertently broadcast towards Earth by other 
civilizations.

Over the past few decades, scientific opinion has 
increasingly supported the theory that complex life has evolved 
on planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy and the universe.  
In some cases, further evolution may have led to the emergence of intelligence, culture and civilization.

While various searches for extraterrestrial radio technology have been made for over the past 30 years, NASA's SETI project will use a combination of state-of-the-art receivers in a systematic, long-range observing program according to Dr. John Billingham, SETI office chief at NASA's Ames Research Center, Mountain View, Calif.  In the first few minutes of the project, more searching will be accomplished than in the combined total of all previous searches, he said.

The SETI project consists of two parts:  a targeted search 
and a sky survey.  The targeted search will use the largest 
available radio telescopes around the world and search over the 
frequency range from 1,000 to 3,000 megahertz (MHz), seeking a 
variety of patterns that may indicate the presence of an 
artificially generated signal.  The targeted search will perform 
the most sensitive search ever conducted of stars similar to our 
sun and less than 80 light-years distant.
                       
In a complementary search, the sky survey will use the 
34-meter antennas at NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) sites in the northern and southern hemispheres to scan the entire sky over the frequency range from 1,000 to 10,000 MHz.  Because of the large increase in the area of sky and frequencies covered, a signal will have to be stronger to be detected by the sky survey.  But it could detect signals emitted in distant regions from directions that would be overlooked if the search were limited only to those stars included in the targeted search.

The quincentennial anniversary of Columbus' discovery of 
America was chosen as the most appropriate time to inaugurate 
this next great exploration search for other places in the 
universe where biological and cultural evolution may have 
occurred, Billingham said.

On Oct. 12, 1992, the targeted search will be initiated on 
the world's largest radio telescope at the National Science 
Foundation's Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the sky 
survey system will be launched at the Goldstone, Calif., DSN 
complex.  Both elements of the SETI project will use specially 
developed digital signal processing systems capable of analyzing 
tens of millions of radio frequency channels simultaneously.*
