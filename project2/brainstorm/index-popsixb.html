		Abstract

	<div class="body">

	How can we explore patterns in massive amounts of visual, user-generated content such as the billions of images and video on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter? How to democratize data mining so such research can be done by designers, artists and students who do not have computer science degree? How do we analyze social media data without thinking about "typical," "popular" or "outliers"? How to use "big data" to question our assumptions about cultures and societies?

	The Software Studies Initiative (softwarestudies.com) was established in 2007 to begin working on these questions. Dr. Lev Manovich will show a number of projects created in his lab, including recent work created for New York Public Library, MoMA and Google. The projects to be shown include comparison of 2.3 million Instagram images from 13 global cities (phototrails.net), an installation exploring Broadway street in NYC using 30 million data points and images (on-broadway.nyc), and an analysis of 1 million artworks from the largest network for user-generated art (deviantart.com). Dr. Manovich will also talk about his current work in progress - an analysis of 265 million images shared on Twitter worldwide between 2011-2014.
